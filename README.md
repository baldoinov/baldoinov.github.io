# Personal Portfolio

Built with [Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio/), a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed for use as a personal website and portfolio. [Here's a live demo](https://jitinnair1.github.io/gradfolio/)

## Editing

- To edit it locally, use:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --trace --incremental --baseurl=""
```

- I've added [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) as a plugin for this theme.
